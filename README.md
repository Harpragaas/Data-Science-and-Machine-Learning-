# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects

Consists of the following projects : 

  1. Bike Share : 
  
      The project performs explorative data analysis on the bike sharing data
      provided determining relationships between different attributes. This project acted as a foundation stone to build my interest towards data analytics and data science.
      
  2. Social Bot or Not : 
  
      The project analyse influence of social bots on Twitter by determining how they contribute to retweet diffusions. The study describes a way to predict the score of all the         users and then do classification to identify bots from the given dataset.
      
  3. Cervical Cancer - Determining chances of cancer on the basis of risk factors :
  
      This project was part of my Bio-inspired Neural Networks course at the Australian National University. The project uses a combination of Decision Tree techniques and Neural       Network in order to determine the chances of cervical cancer based on the risk factors mentioned in the data set.

  4. Basic Web Scraper :
  
     All the data available to us over the web is not readily available and is present in an unstructured format. Thus, Web Scraping is an important tool to get the data in a          structed form that can be used to perform further analysis.
